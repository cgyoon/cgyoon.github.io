		<ul>
	  	<li>1. What do you think are the traditions or heritage of Switzerland today? The tradition here does not refer to relics of the past. It could be a new one. You know, Tradition is handed down from the past to the "present". The past doesn't have to be the 19th century. It can be a few months ago, or years ago. I think it's more important whether it continues today. In a word, I wonder what you think of "today" in Switzerland.</li>
		  <li>2. I wonder if you have any impressions, personal experiences or memories of Korea. It's okay if there's no or you've never been to Korea.</li>
		  <li>3. Who is your favorite designer? It's just a question of personal taste. I wonder why you like. It would be better if you could explain with representative work of the designer as an example.</li>
